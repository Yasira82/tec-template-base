// A way back to the Founding 100 Quest that does not depend on the browser.
//
// ── Why the back button cannot do this job ──────────────────────────────────
//
// Pi Browser has NO TABS. Its top-right control opens an "About Current URL"
// panel with a recently-visited list — there is no second tab to return to, so
// `target="_blank"` on the Quest link is inert there and the Hub page does not
// stay open behind the visit.
//
// That leaves the single history stack, and the first visit to any app pushes
// the whole SSO chain onto it (app landing → Hub SSO → back). Pressing back
// from `/app` walks into that chain and surfaces at the HUB'S OWN LANDING PAGE
// — observed, not theorised. A pioneer who wanted the next app instead gets a
// "Sign in with Pi" screen for a session they already have.
//
// So the return has to be a FORWARD navigation to a known URL. That is the one
// thing that behaves the same in every browser.
//
// ── Why a marker, and why it is remembered ─────────────────────────────────
//
// Zone is a real app with real users; a permanent "back to the Quest" bar would
// be wrong for all of them. The Hub's Quest link carries `?q=1`, and only a
// visitor who arrived that way sees the bar.
//
// It is remembered in `sessionStorage` because the param does NOT survive a
// first visit: `/app?q=1` with no session is redirected to the sign-in landing,
// and the query is dropped on the way. The middleware now carries `q` across
// that hop, the landing captures it here, and the bar appears after sign-in —
// which is exactly the visit where the pioneer is most likely to be lost.
//
// Bounded to six hours: the Quest is one sitting. A flag with no end would
// still be showing a campaign bar to somebody using Zone for its own sake
// tomorrow.
//
// ── Strings live here, not in the dictionaries ─────────────────────────────
//
// This file is copied verbatim into twenty-three apps. A version that also
// needed two dictionary edits per app is a version that gets pasted wrong
// somewhere, and the campaign bar is not app vocabulary.
//
// ── Colour comes from TEC_COLORS — not literals, and not var() ─────────────
//
// Three ways to paint this, and only one survives the whole fleet:
//
//   hex literals   Life's theme guard forbids them in a component, and it is
//                  right: a literal cannot follow a theme.
//   var(--tec-*)   Works in 21 apps. Paints NOTHING in Assets, Commerce and
//                  Ecommerce, whose layouts do not import the token file — and
//                  paints nothing SILENTLY, which is the exact failure that
//                  guard exists to catch.
//   TEC_COLORS     A package every app already depends on, whose values are
//                  plain hex at runtime. Correct with or without the token CSS,
//                  and it follows each app's OWN palette: the three excluded
//                  repos are on tec-ui 2.x, so the bar there matches the app
//                  around it instead of importing the Pi amber into a screen
//                  that has not adopted it.
//
// The `${...}33` alpha suffix is the fleet idiom, and is why these tokens must
// stay plain hex — `var(--tec-gold)33` is invalid CSS that fails without an
// error.
