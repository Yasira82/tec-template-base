/**
 * A session is BOTH cookies — the guard and `/api/auth/me` must agree.
 *
 * Seen on a phone: an app opened from the Hub rendered its screens, and every
 * one of them said "Not signed in". The guard admitted the visitor on
 * `tec_access_token` alone; `/me` also needs `tec_user`. With one cookie
 * lapsed and the other not, the person sat between the two definitions — past
 * the door, with no name and no way to sign in.
 *
 * Run against the real middleware, not its source text: what matters is where
 * a request ends up.
