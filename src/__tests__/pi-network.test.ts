 * Which Pi network a request is on.

 * A `.pi` domain requires a Pi app, and Pi issues every app TWICE — a Mainnet
 * one and a paired Testnet one, both registered against the SAME deployment on
 * different hosts. One build serves both, so `NEXT_PUBLIC_PI_SANDBOX` cannot
 * answer this: it is baked at build time and there is only one build.
 *
 * The consequence of getting it wrong in the permissive direction is a free
 * subscription: a payment made with Test-Pi that a consumer treats as real.
