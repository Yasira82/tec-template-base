// The Pi session for this origin — authenticated ONCE, reused by every caller.
//
// Why this file exists
// --------------------
// `createU2APayment` used to call `Pi.authenticate(...)` unconditionally, on
// every Pay tap. That put the entire Pi handshake AFTER the tap, so the button
// held the user for however long the handshake took.
//
// Normally that is fast. It is NOT fast right after a payment in the Hub: Pi
// Browser is then inside the Hub's Pi app, and the next authenticate here has
// to switch the Pi app context first. Same code, same tap, a much longer wait —
// which is exactly the "I pay in the Hub, come back, and the app payment hangs"
// sequence.
//
// The handshake cannot be made faster; it can be made to happen at a moment
// that costs the user nothing. So it runs on PAGE LOAD (see PiWarmup) while the
// user is still reading the screen, and the tap reuses the result. The wait did
// not get shorter — it moved off the tap.
//
// Two rules this enforces, both learned the hard way:
//   1. Never two concurrent `Pi.authenticate` calls. Pi Browser answers neither
//      reliably; the loser dies silently on its own timer. Every caller here —
//      login and payment — goes through the same single-flight promise.
//   2. Never authenticate in a Hub-owned session (ADR-007). It never answers.
